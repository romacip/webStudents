:speech_balloon: <b> Comments </b>

To check the users added is necessary uncomment line 83. The reason: to modify our file dataStudents.json was necessary edit files with nodeJS but the time was running...   :hourglass_flowing_sand:	

if you want to see more students in the table open the file "dataStudents.json" and copy only the properties to add new students. 

You can order the students by last name (ASC or DESC).
